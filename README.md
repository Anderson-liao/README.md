### Task 1: BST<br>
In my binary search tree code, struct node how I create each node with id, age, left node and right node.<br>
The function insert can insert a node to a binary search tree with input BST, and the id, age of the node you want to insert.<br>
The function search can search a node's age in a BST with its id.<br>
The function remove can remove a node with the given id from the BST.<br>
The function test is just for me to print out the id's of each node in the BST to test my code.<br>
In my main function, I initialize the BST as figure 1 in the sample (line 92 ~ line 101), than add two nodesto the BST(line 103 ~ line 104), than delete a node from BST(line 106), than search the node with id=13 and print its result(line 108 ~ line 109).<br>
### Task 2: AVL<br>
##### Q1<br>
As the definition of an AVL tree, tree (a) is not an AVL tree because the balance factor of node 8 is -2. Tree (b) is an AVL tree because all of balance factors of its nodes are between -1 and 1. Tree (c) is not an AVL tree because the balance factor of node 9 is 2.<br>
##### Q2<br>
The BST from Task 1 is not an AVL tree because the balance factor of the node with id=10 is 2.<br>
##### Q3<br>
